0,Great disinfectant.,"Clorox wipes definitely do a good job in cleaning surfaces. I use the for everything. The only problem is that the wipes do not pick up dust well. However it gather it while you wipe. Also, the wipes dry out pretty quickly so it seems they were really designed for a quick wipe. The new container is designed very well. It folds inwards so that you can grab the cloth without opening the top. When pulling the cloth the lids close and help you rip off the cloth from the roll.","October 6, 2010","Average Rating:

4,"Clorox disinfecting wipes, an excellent product","I have always found Clorox disinfecting wipes to be an excellent product. We use it constantly in our household. For illness & clean up of the sickroom by wiping down all surfaces & equipment you prevent and/or cut down on cross contamination and the spreading of unwanted bacteria. Same with its' use in the bathroom.In the kitchen by using the wipes to clean the counter surfaces you are again helping to prevent the spread of germs ie: ecoil with raw meat. This clorox product just leaves everything clean & smelling so fresh. I try to always have in supply, and on hand

7,Love these!,"These are great to have around to clean small areas quickly. I have also used them to clean big areas. I did not need to use much elbow grease when I used these to clean our bathroom's walls. When we rented our house, the bathroom had at least 10 years of nicotine buildup on the walls. Add some smoke buildup from me liking to burn candles, even in small, enclosed areas and I was looking at the walls as a major project. Thanks to these cleaning clothes, there was more time involved than effort. I did not have to scrub hard to clean the walls, but you can only clean a whole room so fast! I can't imagine how I lived without these!

8,great safe product,"Was a good price for the amount received. I prefer Lysol brand as the wipes are thicker and touger. Clorox brand could improve with stronger wipes and a better pulling system when the wipes come out as they are holding to much liquid. I love wipes for cleaning toilets after guest leave and as a final wipe on kitchen counters, computer keyboards and remote controls. Works great on automobile steering wheel and auto knobs as well. I like to carry extra's when I'm traveling...shopping carts, restrooms that don't have toilet seat covers.
